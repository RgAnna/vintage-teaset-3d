A detailed low-poly 3D model of a vintage-style tea set, optimized for real-time rendering in games and interactive scenes. Includes teapot, cups, saucers, and sugar bowl with PBR textures.
# Vintage Teaset 3D Model

Low-poly 3D model of a vintage tea set designed for real-time applications and game development.

## Description

The model was created based on visual references of vintage tableware. It includes the following components:

- Tray  
- Cup  
- Saucer  
- Teapot  
- Kettle  

The asset is optimized for use in real-time rendering environments. Normal and ambient occlusion maps were baked from a high-poly version with intentional overlapping UV islands to optimize texture space usage.  

Textures include realistic wear and surface imperfections.

## Specifications

- Polygon count (low-poly total): 3,574 tris  
- Texture resolution: 2048Ã—2048  
- Texture maps: Albedo, Normal, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion  
- Texture format: PNG  
- Model formats: FBX, OBJ, BLEND  
- Real-world scale (centimeters)  
- Pivot point at base  
- Clean topology and UV unwrapping  
- UV packing: efficient, without unnecessary empty space  
- Overlapping UV islands used for baking  
- Texel density: approximately 1850 to 2000 pixels per meter
